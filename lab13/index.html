        <h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Working with your your partner to experiment with loops! :D</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>I tried finding a partner through the slack channel for over a week,
        but did not receive any responses. Since the deadline was approaching, I
        made the decision to work on it on my own. Other than that, I didn't have
        problems with the lab itself. I was able to get it done in a timely manner,
        but I am concerned I'll receive lower grade as no one wanted to be my
        partner for this lab. :( </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p> As you can see below, I was able to get the FizzBuzzBoom function to work correctly! :D </p>
