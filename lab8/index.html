	      <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
	      <p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and
            callbacks.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>We had to experiment a bit to get document.write() to work.</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>We had no problems here. The only thing that was wrong was a little coding error which
        was fixable.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Done</p>
