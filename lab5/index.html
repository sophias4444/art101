			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables </h1>
			<img id="make" src = "img/sienna.jpg" />
			<p>For lab 5 we were meant to create js variables about our method of
				trasportation in our consoles. Once we did that, we declared our
				variables in the Javascript file.</p>

	  	<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner had a few mistakes in their javascript file, so some of the
				variables were not showing up on their page. I looked over my partner's
				file and helped them debug their code. Because they were really minor
				errors, it was a quick and easy process. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
		  <p>The result of our lab can be seen in the ttext output below!</p>
