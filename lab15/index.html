        <h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Working with your your partner to experiment with AJAX and JQuery! :D</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p> I looked into a couple of different API's to use for this lab, but realized
          later that many of them required access keys. After experimenting with various
          API's from the programmable web, I was able to figure out how to access the key values
          and have them appear as different paragraphs in my output!</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p> I ended up using the cat fact API to output random  cat facts. This can be seen
            in the output below once you click  the "Generate a fun fact" button! :D
        </p>
        <button id="activate">
            Generate a fun fact!
        </button>
        <div class="input-output">
            <div id="output">

              <br>
