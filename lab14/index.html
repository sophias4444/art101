        <h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Working with your your partner to use debugging knowledge to work on previous labs! :D</p>
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p> I didn't have any problems with my labs, but I did want to make some adjustments to my css for my site. </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p> In the end, I was able to make some adjustments to the file structure on my homepage.
        </p>
        <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <p>The closing tags for the last couple of lines were labeled without a / so I had extra lines between each link.
