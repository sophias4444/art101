		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>My partner had a lot of problems writing the JavaScript and getting it to work in general, but that was because when they tried to call the function, they had mispelled the function name. Instead of "sortUserName", they wrote, "sortUsername". I also had some ttrouble with my js file, but that was because I forgot to add a console log statement once I split the string array. </p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>When you open the webpage it will ask you for your name, and then the user types their name. After the user types their name and presses, "OK", this is the output: </p>
			<div class = output>
				<h2>Script Output</h2>
				<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
			</div>
