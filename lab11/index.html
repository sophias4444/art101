      <div id="challenge" class="section">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p> Working with a partner, the object of this lab is to experiment with
        jQuery. We had to use jQuery to create buttons to add to the Challenge,
      Problems, and Results sections of our lab. </p>
      </div>

      <div id="problems" class="section">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>
          <table>
            One of the problems I encountered was that the text wasn't showing up
            on one of my buttons. After looking over it in the console, I still couldn't
            figure out the error. So I compared by code for the other two buttons and
            realized I was missing a '>'before the 'click here!' button label.
            It turned out to be a syntax error, so it was a simple fix. Another,
            problem I had was with the background change of the results in the
            css. Although the style changes to the classes special and section
            were successfully applied to the challenge and problems sections, it
            wasn't working for the results section.
        </table>
      </p>
      </div>

      <div id="results" class="section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>We were able to succesfully use jQuery to create buttons as seen on
           this page! </p>
