		<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
		<p>The purpose of this lab was to continue to establish a local <fieldset>
			structure on my machine and add index.html files. We needed to create a
			well structured document that had the components outlined in the lab.</p>
		<h2> Difficulties we encountered </h2>
		<p>Because this lab was much more unique in terms of working on our own local
			files, the partner aspect of this lab was a bit confusing. We troubleshooted
			eachothers code and communicated via slack if we had any issues. 
		</fieldset>.</p>

		<p>Go crazy and customize me.</p>
